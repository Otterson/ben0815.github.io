      <hr><br>
        <h5>What is Rush?</h5>
        <p>Rush for the Xi Gamma chapter takes place at the beginning of each semester when Theta Tau recruits prospective members. Before rush there are several on-campus information sessions during which prospective pledges are introduced to the chapter and invited to ask questions about the fraternity and the pledging process. During the process, there are also social events designed to give "rushees" further insight into the chapter and meet active members to find out if Theta Tau is for them. During rush, students are encouraged to attend as many events as possible.  At the end of the rush period, the members of Theta Tau choose who will receive an invitation to continue on to the pledge process. There is NO obligation to pledge just because you attend rush events.</p>

        <h5>Rush Reminders:</h5>
        <p>If you need Help getting to any events off campus, please contact
        Kendrick Lim at (832)623-3163 and he will gladly coordinate with an

          <h4 class="medium italic">Frequently Asked Questions:</h4>
          <p class="left-align">
            <b>Why rush?</b><br>
              Theta Tau is a co-ed, professional fraternity, which means we offer much more than any social fraternity. Our core values are brotherhood, professionalism, and service. We help every engineer gain professionalism and long-lasting friendships throughout their college career. The purpose of Theta Tau is to develop and maintain a high standard of professional interest among its members, and to unite them in a strong bond of fraternal fellowship. <br><br>
            <b>How is the time commitment for this fraternity?</b><br>
            There are weekly events that all members that are encouraged to attend. They are not mandatory, so if your schedule is packed that week, you do not have to attend. However, there are about 2-3 mandatory events every semester that all members MUST attend.<br><br>
            <b>Will joining this organization affect my academic life?</b><br>
            As an organization comprised of fellow engineering students, we understand that school work comes first. That being said, we have members from all different majors who can help give study tips and help explain difficult concepts.<br><br>
            <b>Who can join?</b><br>
            Anyone within the Dwight College of Engineering is welcome to join!<br><br>
            <b>Will I be hazed in the process of joining this fraternity?</b><br>
            Theta Tau emphasizes professionalism as a core value. This means we have a strict no-hazing policy. If at any point you feel that you are being hazed or treated poorly, inform one of the other actives immediately.<br><br>
            <b>Do I have to be a freshman to join?</b><br>
            No, anyone can join. The only restriction is that you cannot be graduating within the next year.<br><br>
            <b>Is there a GPA requirement to join?</b><br>
            As mandated by the university, you need to have a minimum GPA of 2.5 as a pledge. Once you are an active member, you need to maintain a GPA of at least 2.0.<br><br>
            <b>How much does it cost to stay in the fraternity?</b><br>
            It costs $250 per semester, which is significantly less than other Greek fraternities. These dues will be used for events, activities, and food throughout the semester.<br><br>
            <b>What can I expect to get out of joining this fraternity?</b><br>
            Aside from having fun with your brothers, you will gain a lot of professional experience. Many of our members are interns for numerous companies; we have meetings where members who held internships will describe their experiences and what they have learned. There is also a lot of opportunity for networking. We have multiple companies come in and talk to us about how to get an internship with them. In addition, we are a national fraternity, so there are many alumni that will know of this fraternity.<br><br>
